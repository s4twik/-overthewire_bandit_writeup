`ls -l` #it was not giving any list of files it meant there were no files in the home directory so i googled how to find a file from all over the server it showed to use / with find

i watched a video about find command and learned about how files can be searched with particular user and group with -user and -group and since i knew the command -size, i put them together to come up with
`find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c`

i got confused at first with the number of files i got, then i went through them to find "/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password" which didn't end with permission denied so i concatenated it!
`cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password`
```

read about uniq command
used `uniq -u data.txt`

got many answers read the documentation again and found that it only checks the adjacent lines
so i sorted it first then piped it in uniq
`sort data.txt | uniq -u`
```

i read the documentation about strings so just put it use
`strings data.txt`
it workeed i scrolled and the got the the string with many = as mentioned in qustion
then i remembered about `^` in grep command which can make it more efficient
`strings data.txt | grep ^===`
```

```

too much to read first all

started with making a directory called satwik
`mkdir /tmp/satwik`
tried `xxd -r data.txt`
didn't get anything of use
tried `cat data.txt` to see the hexadecimal thing 
read the xxd man file again figuered that i have to pipe the cat in it
`cat data.txt | xxd -r > /tmp/satwik/file1`
`cd satwik` #it didn't work
`cd /tmp/satwik`
had no clue what to do now
read all the documents again. slept .
checked the file type of file1 with file command  `file file1`
since it's in zip compressed so it should be decompressed with zcat
`zcat file1`
nothing happened because i wasn't storing the data anywhere i was just decompressing it
`zcat file1>file2`
`file file2`
it's in zip too so again
`zcat file2> file3`
now i am getting files in bzip2 so it should be decompressed with
`bzcat`
i keep continuing i get tar files i couldn't figure out how to de archive the files so i googled it, it showed me the use of `-xvf`
i got those file and continued the same way. till i got my password
