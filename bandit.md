ls -l #it was not giving any list of files it meant there were no files in the home directory so i googled how to find a file from all over the server it showed to use / with find
i watched a video about find command and learned about how files can be searched with particular user and group with -user and -group and since i knew the command -size, i put them together to come up with
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
i got confused at first with the number of files i got, then i went through them to find "/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password" which didn't end with permission denied so i concatenated it!
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

stard with making a directory called satwik with
`mkdir /tmp/satwik`
tried `xxd -r data.txt`

tried cat data.txt to see the hexadecimal thing 
read the xxd man file again figuered that i have to pipe the cat in it
`cat data.txt | xxd -r > /tmp/satwik/file1`
