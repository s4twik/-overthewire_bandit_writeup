ls -l #it was not giving any list of files it meant there were no files in the home directory so i googled how to find a file from all over the server it showed to use / with find
i watched a video about find command and learned about how files can be searched with particular user and group with -user and -group and since i knew the command -size, i put them together to come up with
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
i got confused at first with the number of files i got, then i went through them to find "/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password" which didn't end with permission denied so i concatenated it!
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

read about uniq command
used uniq -u data.txt
got many answers read the documentation again and found that it only checks the adjacent lines
so i sorted it first then piped it in uniq
sort data.txt | uniq -u
